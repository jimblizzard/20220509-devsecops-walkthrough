## Challenge 0 - Setup

[Home](../readme.md) - [Next >](challenge01.md)

### Introduction

**DevOps** is a broad concept that encompasses people, processes, and tools. The tools you use fall into a number of categories, including version control, Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), Infrastructure-as-Code, and security scanning. Within each category, you have many choices when it comes to implementation.

**DevSecOps** adds security into the mix. It intgrates security as a shared responsibility throughout the entire lifecycle.

In this challenge, you will set up your local machine and cloud environment with the minimum requirements, but the lessons that follow will translate to any DevOps practice, regardless of tooling.

### Description

1. This repository should be forked into your GitHub account. Each person working participating in this workshop should create a new branch in the forked repo.

1. We recommend that you use a non-production (ie, sandbox) Azure subscription for this workshop. Alternatively, you can get a free trial subscription [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

1. Log in to the [Azure Portal](http://portal.azure.com) to confirm that you have an active subscription that you can deploy resources to. 

1. You will not need to insall a Git client or any other tools on your computer, as GitHub Codespaces will be used for the development platform. Codespaces gives you the power of Visual Studio Code in your browser. 

### Success Criteria

- You should now be able to login to both GitHub and Azure with valid accounts for each service.
- You should have your own branch in the GitHub repo and your own GitHub Codespace.
